      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        Peering, the act of autonomous networks on the Internet interconnecting with each other, 
        is driven by both technical and business factors, and can lead to a big impact 
        to the shape of the Internet. This book explains what kind of events have happened 
        on the Internet from the perspective of players in Japan, and how they have brought
        not only changes to the Internet but also to the real world, through the following chapters;
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-3">
        <li>Chapter 1. The secret peering battle</li>
        <li>Chapter 2. Data centers and their location</li>
        <li>Chapter 3. What an IX is and the differences between markets</li>
        <li>Chapter 4. How to find your peer</li>
        <li>Chapter 5. Rise of content providers</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
        The book was originally written in Japanese and 
        <a href="https://www.lambdanote.com/products/peering" class="text-blue-600 visited:text-purple-600">

        The translation work was done by industry volunteers who are not native English speakers. 
        We did not hire a professional translator as we wanted to prioritize releasing this English version 
        free of charge so that the global community may have access to this material and the only thing 
        one would need to read this book is an Internet connection and some gadget that can display epub 
        format documents. 
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
        Generative AI tools were also early stages when we did most of this work, 
        but we imagine if there was a chance to redo this now, AI would be of great help in articulation 
        (for avoidance of doubt, this section is not written using AI). 
        As you read this translation work, you may encounter some phrases and edits that seem odd to you, 
        but weâ€™d like to request your understanding that we may not be able to fix them. 
        Like peering, this material is provided on a best effort basis, and is settlement free.
